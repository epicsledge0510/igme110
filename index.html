            <h1>Modding has become an important part of PC gaming as it has allowed the players to change the game that they are playing in order to fit their liking, be it a massive change, or a small one. Because of this, some games have been able to take on whole new meanings as well as become entirely new games. Due to the fact that these mods are changing the game there has also been some criticism against them. </h1>
