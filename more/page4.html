                <h1>Mods can also create other issues for the developers of a game as it can lead to the reveal of features or other things that the developers hid that were never to be found, such as the Grand Theft Auto Hot Coffee minigame. After the release of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, modders discovered that within the code there was a way to access files from a cut minigame that, upon the publication of this discovery, led to a massive recall of copies as well as a rerating to an “adults only” rating, causing a huge dilemma for the developers of the game , all as a result of mods.</h1>
