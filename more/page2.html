            <h1>One game where mods have become rather important is a game called “Just Cause 2”, a single player open world game developed by Avalanche Studios in 2010. When this game released it was well received, but led to players online wishing that they could enjoy the massive amount of freedom with friends. This led to the creation of a mod that allowed players to play together on online servers, which allowed them to finally do this, as well as some other features specific to individual servers. PCWorld talks about this game by saying “if you thought Just Cause 2 was chaotic playing by your lonesome, try having hundreds of people running around the island of Panau simultaneously”  in their article about the 10 most influential mods in video games. The mod has allowed the game to last past the lifespan of its own series as it has an average of about 200 players daily , which while this may not be a lot compared to other games, however, Just Cause 4, which released only this year, only manages to reach an average of about 400 daily players. While the series has indisputably gone down in popularity over the years, the second game has managed to stay towards the top of the series thanks to its multiplayer mod.</h1>
